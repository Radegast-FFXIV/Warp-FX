# Summary
A suite of shaders that in no way make your game look any more appealing. Use them anyways.

# Changelog
## v1.0.0 (Baseline)
- Baseline release for already released shaders. This should provide more stability to end-users.
# Shaders
This list of shaders will grow as I figure out more ways of exploding peoples screens into some interesting effects. 
### Swirl
Distorts the screen by twisting pixels around a certain point.
### Wave
Distorts the screen in one of two ways: a sinesoidal distortion or a stretch/squeeze distortion.
### Zigzag
A more advanced version of the Swirl shader that twists pixels back and forth around a certain point.
### Bulge/Pinch
Stretches or squeezes pixels around a certain point.
### Tiny Planet
Emulates the projection of the screen onto a sphere. Can be used to create a tiny planet from a horizon. 
### Slit Scan
Scans a column of pixels and outputs them to a sliding buffer to the side.
